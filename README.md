This project was made to showcase in the TVS Credit Epic S4 Hackathon Finale Round. 
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap were used to create the front end of this website, and machine language algorithms like logistic regression were utilised to create the back end.To link the backend and the frontend of this model, I used Flask.
